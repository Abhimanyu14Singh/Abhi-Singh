# SkyFrame internal contract (backend ↔ frontend ↔ tests)

Units everywhere: kN, m, tonne, s. E in kPa. Loads kN / kN/m. Mass tonne.

## Python engine interface

```python
from skyframe.core.model import BuildingModel
from skyframe.core.builder import quick_building
from skyframe.engine.opensees_engine import OpenSeesEngine

model = quick_building(...)          # or hand-built BuildingModel
engine = OpenSeesEngine(model)
results = engine.run()               # runs all static cases + combos + modal
d = results.to_dict()                # JSON-safe dict, shape below
```

`OpenSeesEngine` must also expose:
- `engine.run_static(case_name) -> CaseResults` (single case)
- `engine.run_modal(num_modes=None) -> ModalResults`

## results.to_dict() JSON shape

```jsonc
{
  "model_name": "…",
  "nodes": {"<tag>": [x, y, z]},                 // every FE node
  "members": [{"uid": "C1-A1", "kind": "column|beam|brace", "section": "COL",

    }
  },
  "combos": { "<combo>": <same shape as a case> },

## Flask HTTP API (module `skyframe.api.server`, `create_app()` factory)

| Method | Path              | Body / Response |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| GET    | `/`               | SPA (serves `skyframe/api/web/index.html`; static files under `/static/<path>` from same dir) |
| GET    | `/api/health`     | `{"status":"ok","opensees":true}` |
| GET    | `/api/model`      | current `model.to_dict()` |
| POST   | `/api/model/quick`| body = quick_building kwargs (all optional): `{name, bays_x, bay_width_x, bays_y, bay_width_y, stories, story_height, E, column_size, beam_b, beam_h, dead_udl, live_udl, quake_coeff, base_fixity}` → new `model.to_dict()` |
| POST   | `/api/analyze`    | no body → `results.to_dict()` (runs on current model). 400 with `{"error": "…"}` on failure |

Server keeps ONE current model in memory (default: `quick_building()` at startup).
`python -m skyframe.api.server` runs on port 8600.

# v0.2 additions — drawing, shells/walls/slabs, meshing, member analysis

## Model additions (`skyframe/core/model.py`)

```python
@dataclass ShellSection:   # ElasticMembranePlateSection in OpenSees
    name: str; material: str; thickness: float          # m
@dataclass ShellRegion:    # planar quad region (wall or slab)
    uid: str; kind: str            # "wall" | "slab"
    behavior: str                  # "shell" (meshed FE) | "membrane" (slabs only: no FE,
                                   #   two-way tributary load distribution to edge beams)
    section: str                   # ShellSection name (unused for membrane)
    corners: List[Tuple[x,y,z]]    # 4 corners, planar, counter-clockwise
    mesh_size: float = 1.0         # m target element size (shell behavior)
    story: str = ""
@dataclass AreaLoad:               # in LoadPattern.area_loads
    region_uid: str; q: float      # kPa, positive DOWNWARD (gravity)
# FrameMember gains: releases: str = ""   # any of "Mi","Mj" tokens comma-sep →
#   moment released about BOTH local y & z at that end (OpenSees -releasez/-releasey)
# MemberUDL replaced-by/extended-with MemberLoad list in LoadPattern.member_loads:
@dataclass MemberLoad:
    member_uid: str
    kind: str = "udl"              # "udl" | "point" | "trapezoid"
    w: float = 0.0                 # kN/m at start (udl/trapezoid), kN for point (P)
    w2: float = 0.0                # kN/m at end (trapezoid)
    a: float = 0.0                 # start position (fraction 0..1 of length); point: position
    b: float = 1.0                 # end position (fraction)
    direction: str = "gravity"     # "gravity" (global -Z) | "local_y" | "global_x|y|z"
# LoadPattern gains: area_loads: List[AreaLoad]; member_udls kept as alias/legacy or migrated.
# BuildingModel gains: shell_sections: Dict[str, ShellSection]; shells: List[ShellRegion]
# BuildingModel.from_dict(d) classmethod: full round-trip of to_dict().
```

## Meshing (`skyframe/core/mesh.py`)

`mesh_model(model) -> MeshedModel`:
- Each shell-behavior ShellRegion → structured quad mesh (nx×ny from mesh_size).
- Node dedup/merge across regions and frame member endpoints (tol 1e-6).
- **Compatibility**: any frame member whose axis lies along shell-region edges is
  SPLIT into segments so its intermediate nodes coincide with edge mesh nodes.
  Split segments keep the parent uid; engine re-aggregates station results so
  reported member results always refer to the ORIGINAL member.
- Membrane slabs are NOT meshed: their area loads become trapezoid/triangle
  MemberLoads on edge beams (two-way tributary at 45°), load total conserved.

## Engine additions

- ShellMITC4 + ElasticMembranePlateSection for meshed regions; shell self-weight
  ignored v0.2 (mass unchanged: diaphragm/story mass model).
- Member releases via elasticBeamColumn '-releasez'/'-releasey' codes.
- MemberLoad handling: full-span udl → eleLoad beamUniform; point → beamPoint;
  partial/trapezoid → EXACT equivalent end forces (closed-form fixed-end forces
  applied as reversed nodal loads) + Python-side member-end-force correction.
- Area loads on shell regions → consistent nodal loads (tributary area × q).
- Station results: 11 equally spaced stations per ORIGINAL member computed by
  statics from end forces + member loads (exact for prismatic members).

## results.to_dict() additions

```jsonc
{
  "shell_quads": [{"region": "W1", "nodes": [n1,n2,n3,n4]}],   // meshed FE quads
  "cases": { "<case>": {
      "member_stations": {"<uid>": {"x": [0,...,L], "N": [...], "V2": [...],
                                     "V3": [...], "T": [...], "M2": [...], "M3": [...]}},
      // node_disp already covers shell nodes
  }}
}
```

## API additions

| Method | Path         | Body / Response |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| POST   | `/api/model` | full model dict (BuildingModel.from_dict) → echoed model dict; 400 {"error"} on invalid |

## Drawing UI (frontend)

Draw mode with plan-view story editor: tools Column / Beam / Wall / Slab / Select
/ Erase, section & load assignment on selection, story selector + "apply to
similar stories", saves via POST /api/model. 3D renders shell regions as
translucent filled quads (mesh lines once analyzed), deformed shells, and a
member-detail panel with N/V2/M3 diagrams from member_stations.

## model.to_dict() (already implemented, see `skyframe/core/model.py`)

Members carry `pi`/`pj` coordinate triples; the UI draws from `to_dict()` of
model (geometry) + results (deformations keyed by node tag; node coords in
results.nodes).

---

# v0.3 additions — save/open, response spectrum, P-Delta, section library

## Model save/open API

Saved models are `<name>.skyframe.json` files (the exact `model.to_dict()`
JSON) in a models directory: default `~/.skyframe/models`, overridable via
the `SKYFRAME_MODELS_DIR` environment variable; created on demand.  Names
must match `[A-Za-z0-9 _-]{1,60}` (else 400).

| Method | Path                      | Body / Response |
|--------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| GET    | `/api/models`             | `[{"name", "mtime", "stories", "members"}, …]` (mtime = epoch seconds; stories/members = counts) |
| POST   | `/api/models/<name>`      | saves the CURRENT model → its listing entry; 400 `{"error"}` on a bad name |
| POST   | `/api/models/<name>/open` | loads the file into the current model (`BuildingModel.from_dict`) → model dict; 404 if missing, 400 if the file is invalid |
| DELETE | `/api/models/<name>`      | `{"deleted": name}`; 404 if missing |

## Response-spectrum analysis (RSA)

```python
@dataclass ResponseSpectrumCase:
    name: str
    direction: str                 # "X" | "Y"
    spectrum: List[[T, Sa]]        # T in s, Sa in g; LINEAR interpolation at
                                   #   modal periods, clamped to end values
    num_modes: int = 0             # 0 = all computed modes
    combo_method: str = "CQC"      # "CQC" | "SRSS"
    damping: float = 0.05          # constant modal damping ratio (CQC)
    scale: float = 1.0             # multiplies Sa
# BuildingModel gains: rs_cases: Dict[str, ResponseSpectrumCase]
#   (+ add_rs_case(...)); included in to_dict()/from_dict() as "rs_cases".
# RS cases may NOT appear inside LoadCombos (v0.3 keeps them separate).
```

Engine (`engine.run_response_spectrum(name) -> CaseResults`, also run by
`engine.run()`): exact modal statics — per mode the equivalent static force
vector `f_i = Γ_i · Sa_i · g · M · φ_i` is applied as nodal loads and solved
through the ordinary linear static pipeline, then every quantity is combined
across modes (CQC with the standard constant-damping correlation
coefficient, or SRSS).  Story drifts are combined per mode (ETABS-style),
NOT recomputed from combined displacements.  All RSA results are POSITIVE
envelopes.

`results.to_dict()` gains `"rs_cases": {"<name>": <same shape as a case>}`
(node_disp / reactions / base / member_forces / story / member_stations, all
combined absolute values; story shear = combined cumulative modal force).

Modal `participation` entries gain the participation FACTORS `"gamma_x"` /
`"gamma_y"` per mode (`Γ = L/M*`; sign follows the eigenvector
normalisation — `Γ·φ` is normalisation-invariant).

## P-Delta static cases

```python
# LoadCase gains:
#   pdelta: bool = False
#   pdelta_gravity: Dict[str, float] | None = None   # pattern -> factor;
#       None => the case's own patterns ARE the gravity state
```

When `pdelta` is on, ALL frame members use `geomTransf('PDelta', …)` — the
linearized "lean-column" geometric stiffness (−P/L on the transverse sway
translations) — and the case is solved with Newton
(`test NormDispIncr 1e-8 20`).  With a distinct `pdelta_gravity` state the
engine runs two stages: gravity first, `loadConst -time 0.0`, then the
case's own loads; the reported result is the case's INCREMENT past the
gravity state (standard linearized-P-Delta case output).  A pure-gravity
P-Delta case (`pdelta_gravity=None`) is a single reported stage.
Non-convergence raises a clear error.  Combos that superpose a P-Delta case
still combine linearly but carry
`"warning": "superposition includes a P-Delta (nonlinear) case; …"` in the
combo's results dict (the key is absent for all-linear combos).

## Steel section library

`skyframe/core/sections_library.py`: 22 common AISC W-shapes (W8x31 …
W36x150) with A, I33, I22, J (and drawing b/h) converted exactly from the
AISC Manual (15th ed.) imperial values to SI (m).  API:

| Method | Path                    | Response |
|--------|-------------------------|----------|
| GET    | `/api/sections/library` | `[{"name", "A", "I33", "I22", "J", "b", "h"}, …]` (SI units) |

`FrameSection.from_library("W12x26", material)` builds a ready-to-add
section from the library.
