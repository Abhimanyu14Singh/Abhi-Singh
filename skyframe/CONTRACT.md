# SkyFrame internal contract (backend ↔ frontend ↔ tests)

Units everywhere: kN, m, tonne, s. E in kPa. Loads kN / kN/m. Mass tonne.

## Python engine interface

```python
from skyframe.core.model import BuildingModel
from skyframe.core.builder import quick_building
from skyframe.engine.opensees_engine import OpenSeesEngine

model = quick_building(...)          # or hand-built BuildingModel
engine = OpenSeesEngine(model)
results = engine.run()               # runs all static cases + combos + modal
d = results.to_dict()                # JSON-safe dict, shape below
```

`OpenSeesEngine` must also expose:
- `engine.run_static(case_name) -> CaseResults` (single case)
- `engine.run_modal(num_modes=None) -> ModalResults`

## results.to_dict() JSON shape

```jsonc
{
  "model_name": "…",
  "nodes": {"<tag>": [x, y, z]},                 // every FE node

# v0.2 additions — drawing, shells/walls/slabs, meshing, member analysis

## Model additions (`skyframe/core/model.py`)

```python
@dataclass ShellSection:   # ElasticMembranePlateSection in OpenSees
    name: str; material: str; thickness: float          # m
@dataclass ShellRegion:    # planar quad region (wall or slab)
    uid: str; kind: str            # "wall" | "slab"
    behavior: str                  # "shell" (meshed FE) | "membrane" (slabs only: no FE,
                                   #   two-way tributary load distribution to edge beams)
    section: str                   # ShellSection name (unused for membrane)

# MemberUDL replaced-by/extended-with MemberLoad list in LoadPattern.member_loads:
@dataclass MemberLoad:
    member_uid: str
    kind: str = "udl"              # "udl" | "point" | "trapezoid"
    w: float = 0.0                 # kN/m at start (udl/trapezoid), kN for point (P)
    w2: float = 0.0                # kN/m at end (trapezoid)
    a: float = 0.0                 # start position (fraction 0..1 of length); point: position
    b: float = 1.0                 # end position (fraction)
    direction: str = "gravity"     # "gravity" (global -Z) | "local_y" | "global_x|y|z"
# LoadPattern gains: area_loads: List[AreaLoad]; member_udls kept as alias/legacy or migrated.
# BuildingModel gains: shell_sections: Dict[str, ShellSection]; shells: List[ShellRegion]
# BuildingModel.from_dict(d) classmethod: full round-trip of to_dict().
```

## Meshing (`skyframe/core/mesh.py`)

`mesh_model(model) -> MeshedModel`:
- Each shell-behavior ShellRegion → structured quad mesh (nx×ny from mesh_size).
- Node dedup/merge across regions and frame member endpoints (tol 1e-6).
- **Compatibility**: any frame member whose axis lies along shell-region edges is
  SPLIT into segments so its intermediate nodes coincide with edge mesh nodes.
  Split segments keep the parent uid; engine re-aggregates station results so
  reported member results always refer to the ORIGINAL member.
- Membrane slabs are NOT meshed: their area loads become trapezoid/triangle
  MemberLoads on edge beams (two-way tributary at 45°), load total conserved.

## Engine additions

- ShellMITC4 + ElasticMembranePlateSection for meshed regions; shell self-weight
  ignored v0.2 (mass unchanged: diaphragm/story mass model).
- Member releases via elasticBeamColumn '-releasez'/'-releasey' codes.
- MemberLoad handling: full-span udl → eleLoad beamUniform; point → beamPoint;
  partial/trapezoid → EXACT equivalent end forces (closed-form fixed-end forces
  applied as reversed nodal loads) + Python-side member-end-force correction.
- Area loads on shell regions → consistent nodal loads (tributary area × q).
- Station results: 11 equally spaced stations per ORIGINAL member computed by
  statics from end forces + member loads (exact for prismatic members).

## results.to_dict() additions

```jsonc
{
  "shell_quads": [{"region": "W1", "nodes": [n1,n2,n3,n4]}],   // meshed FE quads
  "cases": { "<case>": {
      "member_stations": {"<uid>": {"x": [0,...,L], "N": [...], "V2": [...],
                                     "V3": [...], "T": [...], "M2": [...], "M3": [...]}},
      // node_disp already covers shell nodes
  }}
}
```

## API additions

| Method | Path         | Body / Response |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| POST   | `/api/model` | full model dict (BuildingModel.from_dict) → echoed model dict; 400 {"error"} on invalid |

## Drawing UI (frontend)

Draw mode with plan-view story editor: tools Column / Beam / Wall / Slab / Select
/ Erase, section & load assignment on selection, story selector + "apply to
similar stories", saves via POST /api/model. 3D renders shell regions as
translucent filled quads (mesh lines once analyzed), deformed shells, and a
member-detail panel with N/V2/M3 diagrams from member_stations.

## model.to_dict() (already implemented, see `skyframe/core/model.py`)

Members carry `pi`/`pj` coordinate triples; the UI draws from `to_dict()` of
model (geometry) + results (deformations keyed by node tag; node coords in
results.nodes).

---

# v0.3 additions — save/open, response spectrum, P-Delta, section library

## Model save/open API

Saved models are `<name>.skyframe.json` files (the exact `model.to_dict()`
JSON) in a models directory: default `~/.skyframe/models`, overridable via
the `SKYFRAME_MODELS_DIR` environment variable; created on demand.  Names
must match `[A-Za-z0-9 _-]{1,60}` (else 400).

| Method | Path                      | Body / Response |
|--------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| GET    | `/api/models`             | `[{"name", "mtime", "stories", "members"}, …]` (mtime = epoch seconds; stories/members = counts) |
| POST   | `/api/models/<name>`      | saves the CURRENT model → its listing entry; 400 `{"error"}` on a bad name |
| POST   | `/api/models/<name>/open` | loads the file into the current model (`BuildingModel.from_dict`) → model dict; 404 if missing, 400 if the file is invalid |
| DELETE | `/api/models/<name>`      | `{"deleted": name}`; 404 if missing |

## Response-spectrum analysis (RSA)

```python
@dataclass ResponseSpectrumCase:
    name: str
    direction: str                 # "X" | "Y"
    spectrum: List[[T, Sa]]        # T in s, Sa in g; LINEAR interpolation at
                                   #   modal periods, clamped to end values
    num_modes: int = 0             # 0 = all computed modes
    combo_method: str = "CQC"      # "CQC" | "SRSS"
    damping: float = 0.05          # constant modal damping ratio (CQC)
    scale: float = 1.0             # multiplies Sa
# BuildingModel gains: rs_cases: Dict[str, ResponseSpectrumCase]
#   (+ add_rs_case(...)); included in to_dict()/from_dict() as "rs_cases".
# RS cases may NOT appear inside LoadCombos (v0.3 keeps them separate).
```

Engine (`engine.run_response_spectrum(name) -> CaseResults`, also run by
`engine.run()`): exact modal statics — per mode the equivalent static force
vector `f_i = Γ_i · Sa_i · g · M · φ_i` is applied as nodal loads and solved
through the ordinary linear static pipeline, then every quantity is combined
across modes (CQC with the standard constant-damping correlation
coefficient, or SRSS).  Story drifts are combined per mode (ETABS-style),
NOT recomputed from combined displacements.  All RSA results are POSITIVE
envelopes.

`results.to_dict()` gains `"rs_cases": {"<name>": <same shape as a case>}`
(node_disp / reactions / base / member_forces / story / member_stations, all
combined absolute values; story shear = combined cumulative modal force).

Modal `participation` entries gain the participation FACTORS `"gamma_x"` /
`"gamma_y"` per mode (`Γ = L/M*`; sign follows the eigenvector
normalisation — `Γ·φ` is normalisation-invariant).

## P-Delta static cases

```python
# LoadCase gains:
#   pdelta: bool = False
#   pdelta_gravity: Dict[str, float] | None = None   # pattern -> factor;
#       None => the case's own patterns ARE the gravity state
```

When `pdelta` is on, ALL frame members use `geomTransf('PDelta', …)` — the
linearized "lean-column" geometric stiffness (−P/L on the transverse sway
translations) — and the case is solved with Newton
(`test NormDispIncr 1e-8 20`).  With a distinct `pdelta_gravity` state the
engine runs two stages: gravity first, `loadConst -time 0.0`, then the
case's own loads; the reported result is the case's INCREMENT past the
gravity state (standard linearized-P-Delta case output).  A pure-gravity
P-Delta case (`pdelta_gravity=None`) is a single reported stage.
Non-convergence raises a clear error.  Combos that superpose a P-Delta case
still combine linearly but carry
`"warning": "superposition includes a P-Delta (nonlinear) case; …"` in the
combo's results dict (the key is absent for all-linear combos).

## Steel section library

`skyframe/core/sections_library.py`: 22 common AISC W-shapes (W8x31 …
W36x150) with A, I33, I22, J (and drawing b/h) converted exactly from the
AISC Manual (15th ed.) imperial values to SI (m).  API:

| Method | Path                    | Response |
|--------|-------------------------|----------|
| GET    | `/api/sections/library` | `[{"name", "A", "I33", "I22", "J", "b", "h"}, …]` (SI units) |

`FrameSection.from_library("W12x26", material)` builds a ready-to-add
section from the library.

# v0.4 additions — envelope combos, mass source, stiffness modifiers, auto wind, linear time history, column orientation, shell forces

## Envelope load combos

```python
# LoadCombo gains:
#   combo_type: str = "add"        # "add" | "envelope"
```

* ``"add"`` — linear result superposition (unchanged v0.1 behavior).
* ``"envelope"`` — per-quantity **min/max over the LISTED cases**, each
  case's results multiplied by its factor first.  Envelope combos may
  reference static load cases ONLY (no RS/TH cases, no other combos).
* Results shape: ``results["combos"][name]`` keeps the standard case shape
  holding the **MAX** values, plus a nested ``"min"`` key with the same
  shape (node_disp / reactions / base / member_forces / story /
  member_stations) holding the **MINIMA**.  ``shell_forces`` are NOT
  enveloped in v0.4 (key absent on envelope combos).
* An envelope that lists a P-Delta case carries a ``"warning"`` string
  (factored nonlinear results enter the envelope unchanged).

## Mass source

```python
# BuildingModel gains:
#   mass_source: Dict[str, float]   # pattern -> factor, e.g. {"DEAD": 1.0, "LIVE": 0.25}
```

``compute_story_masses`` uses ``mass_source`` when non-empty, else falls
back to the legacy ``mass_from_patterns`` (which is retained and still
serialised).  ``quick_building`` sets ``mass_source = {"DEAD": 1.0}``.
``from_dict`` without a ``"mass_source"`` key (pre-v0.4 files) keeps the
legacy behavior exactly.  Explicit ``story_masses`` still win per story.

## Stiffness modifiers

```python
# FrameSection gains (all default 1.0, must be finite and > 0):
#   mod_A, mod_I33, mod_I22, mod_J
# ShellSection gains:
#   mod: float = 1.0     # single modifier, scales the section E
```

The engine multiplies A/I33/I22/J by their modifiers when creating
``elasticBeamColumn`` elements (and inside the exact fixed-end-force
member-load path, so member loads stay exact).  ``ShellSection.mod`` scales
E of the ``ElasticMembranePlateSection``: membrane AND flexural stiffness
scale together — ElasticMembranePlateSection has a single modulus, so
independent membrane/flexural modifiers are NOT offered (a silent
approximation was rejected).  Full ``to_dict``/``from_dict`` round-trip;
absent keys default to 1.0.

## Auto wind pattern (ASCE 7-style)

```python
from skyframe.core.builder import make_wind_pattern, wind_kz, wind_qz
make_wind_pattern(model, name, direction,        # "X" | "Y"
                  basic_wind_speed,              # V, m/s
                  exposure="C",                  # "B" | "C" | "D"
                  cp_total=1.3, importance=1.0) -> LoadPattern
```

* ``Kz = 2.01 (z/zg)^(2/alpha)`` with ASCE 7-16 Table 26.10-1 parameters
  B: alpha=7.0, zg=365.76 m; C: 9.5/274.32; D: 11.5/213.36; z floored at
  4.6 m (applied to ALL exposures — documented simplification; ASCE uses
  9.14 m for B).
* ``qz = 0.613 Kz Kzt Kd V^2 I`` Pa -> kPa, with Kzt = 1.0, Kd = 0.85.
* Story force at each story level: ``F = qz(story top elev) * cp_total *
  trib_height * width`` where trib_height = half story below + half story
  above (top story: half itself), width = plan extent PERPENDICULAR to the
  wind from ``model.plan_extents()``.
* Creates/replaces ``model.patterns[name]`` with kind ``"wind"`` carrying
  only ``story_forces`` (fx for "X", fy for "Y").

| Method | Path                 | Body / Response |
|--------|----------------------|-----------------|
| POST   | `/api/pattern/wind`  | `{name?, direction?, V, exposure?, Cp?, importance?}` -> updated model dict; 400 `{"error"}` on bad input.  Defaults: name "WIND", direction "X", exposure "C", Cp 1.3, importance 1.0. |

## Linear time-history analysis

```python
@dataclass TimeHistoryCase:      # model.th_cases: Dict[str, TimeHistoryCase]
    name: str
    direction: str               # "X" | "Y"
    accel: List[float]           # ground accel, m/s^2, sample k at t = k*dt
    dt: float                    # s
    damping: float = 0.05        # Rayleigh target ratio
    scale: float = 1.0           # multiplies accel
# BuildingModel.add_th_case(...); serialised under "th_cases"; TH cases may
# NOT enter load combos.
```

Engine ``run_time_history(name) -> THResults`` (also run by ``run()``):

* uniform ground excitation (OpenSees ``UniformExcitation`` + ``Path``
  time series), Newmark constant-average acceleration (gamma=1/2, beta=1/4,
  unconditionally stable), one step per record sample at the record dt,
  ``algorithm Linear`` (elastic model);
* Rayleigh damping ``C = a0 M + a1 K`` fitted to ``damping`` at modes 1 and
  min(3, n): ``a0 = 2 z w_i w_j/(w_i+w_j)``, ``a1 = 2 z/(w_i+w_j)``;
* recorded per step (entry k = state at t=(k+1)dt): story ux/uy (diaphragm
  masters, else story-node average) and total base reactions FX/FY.

``results["th_cases"][name]`` shape:

```jsonc
{
  "t": [dt, 2*dt, ...],
  "story_ux": {"Story1": [...]}, "story_uy": {...},   // m
  "base_FX": [...], "base_FY": [...],                 // kN (reactions)
  "peaks": {                                          // peak ABSOLUTE values
    "story": {"Story1": {"ux":0,"uy":0,"drift_x":0,"drift_y":0,
                          "shear_x":0,"shear_y":0}},  // drift = ratio
    "base": {"FX":0,"FY":0}
  }
}
```

Peak story shears come from inertia-force equilibrium (story/nodal masses x
total accelerations, cumulative from the top; damping forces neglected —
documented approximation).  **Step cap:** ``engine.run()`` skips ALL TH
cases when their total step count exceeds 20 000 and sets a top-level
``"warning"`` string in the results; ``run_time_history`` itself is never
capped.  RS/combos never include TH cases.

## Column orientation angle

```python
# FrameMember gains:
#   angle: float = 0.0    # degrees, right-hand rotation of the local y/z
#                         # axes about the member axis (local +x)
```

The engine rotates the default local triad by ``angle`` and feeds the
rotated local z as the ``geomTransf`` vecxz — for a vertical rectangular
column, ``angle=90`` exactly swaps the sway stiffness directions.  Applies
to all members; ``"local_y"`` member loads follow the rotated axes.
``add_member(..., angle=...)``; round-trips through to_dict/from_dict.

## Shell element forces

``results["cases"][case]["shell_forces"]`` (also on additive combos, by
superposition; key ABSENT when the model has no meshed shells, on envelope
combos, and on RS/TH results):

```jsonc
"shell_forces": {"<quad_index>": [Nxx, Nyy, Nxy, Mxx, Myy, Mxy, Vxz, Vyz]}
```

``quad_index`` is the index into ``results["shell_quads"]`` (whose entries
already carry the ``region`` mapping).  Values are the average of the 4
ShellMITC4 gauss-point stress resultants (= centroid values for a bilinear
field), in the ELEMENT local system: membrane forces kN/m, moments kN*m/m,
transverse shears kN/m.  P-Delta two-stage cases report the increment past
the gravity state, consistent with every other quantity.

## Top-level results additions

* ``"th_cases": {"<name>": <TH shape above>}`` (always present, may be {})
* ``"warning": "..."`` — present only when set (e.g. TH step cap).
